# HAProxy Ingress controller

[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) controller
implementation for [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) loadbalancer.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress) [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress)

HAProxy Ingress is a Kubernetes ingress controller: it configures a HAProxy instance
to route incoming requests from an external network to the in-cluster applications.
The routing configurations are built reading specs from the Kubernetes cluster.
Updates made to the cluster are applied on the fly to the HAProxy instance.

## Develop HAProxy Ingress

Building HAProxy Ingress:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/jcmoraisjr
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jcmoraisjr
git clone https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress.git
cd haproxy-ingress
make
```

The following `make` targets are currently supported:

* `install`: run `go install` which saves some building time.
* `build` (default): compiles HAProxy Ingress and generates an ELF (Linux) executable at `rootfs/haproxy-ingress-controller` despite the source platform.
* `test`: run unit tests
* `image`: generates a Docker image tagged `localhost/haproxy-ingress:latest`
